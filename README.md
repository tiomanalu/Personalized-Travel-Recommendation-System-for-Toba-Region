# Recommendation System Project - Group 10

Welcome to the **Recommendation System Project** repository! 🎉🌍

This project aims to harness the power of **recommendation algorithms** to assist travelers in discovering the best destinations in the **Toba region**, leveraging a robust dataset of tourism-related information. Using **Content-Based Filtering (CBF)** and **Collaborative Filtering (CF)**, we provide personalized and data-driven recommendations tailored to user preferences and interactions. 🧳✨

## Features 🌟
- **Personalized Destination Recommendations**: Tailored suggestions based on user preferences and past interactions. 🏖️
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends destinations similar to user-selected preferences (e.g., nature, culture). 🌄
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Leverages community data to suggest popular or highly rated destinations. 🤝
- **Real-Time Suggestions**: Updates recommendations as users interact with the system. ⏱️

## Dataset 🗂️
Our dataset includes:
- Tourism-related data from the **Toba region**. 🗺️
- User interaction logs (ratings, clicks, preferences). 📝
- Descriptive information about destinations (categories, activities, locations). 🏕️

---

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **Programming Languages**: Python 🐍
- **Frameworks**: Flask/Django for backend development 🌐
- **Libraries**: 
  - Scikit-learn (machine learning algorithms) 🤖
  - Pandas and NumPy (data manipulation) 📊
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn (data visualization) 📈
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MySQL for data storage 💾
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS/Heroku for hosting 🚢

## How It Works ⚙️
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Cleans and organizes the tourism dataset. 🧹
   - Normalizes and formats user interactions and destination attributes. 📑

2. **Recommendation Algorithms**:
   - **Content-Based Filtering**: Matches user-selected destination features with available options. 🔍
   - **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses user-item matrices to predict preferences. 🤝

3. **Recommendation Generation**:
   - Combines CBF and CF outputs. 🔄
   - Ranks and filters results based on user behavior and ratings. 📋

4. **User Interaction**:
   - Users input preferences through an intuitive interface. 💻
   - Real-time recommendations are displayed, refined by ongoing interactions. 🌟

## Setup Instructions 📖
1. **Clone Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Group10/Recommendation-System.git
   cd Recommendation-System
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     python -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Database Configuration**:
   - Update database credentials in `config.py`. 🛠️
   - Run migrations to set up tables:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

4. **Run Application**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   Access the app at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. 🌐
