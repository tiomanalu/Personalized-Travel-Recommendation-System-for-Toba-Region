# Recommendation-System-Project-Group-10
Welcome to the Recommendation-System-Project-Group-10 repository! 🎉 This project explores the power of recommendation algorithms to help travelers find the best destinations in the beautiful Toba region, using a rich dataset of tourism-related data. By implementing a combination of Content-Based Filtering (CBF), Collaborative Filtering (CF), this project aims to provide personalized and data-driven recommendations based on user preferences and interactions.

### 🚀 Project Overview
In this repository, you’ll find three Jupyter Notebook files, each implementing a different recommendation system approach:

# `🗂️ 015_029_059_Kelompok10_SVD
This notebook implements a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based recommendation system using Collaborative Filtering. The algorithm decomposes the user-item interaction matrix to uncover latent relationships between elements and generate recommendations.

Key Concepts:
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- Collaborative Filtering

# `🗂️ KNN 
This notebook utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to build a similarity-based recommendation system. The model recommends items based on the proximity of features between items or users.

Key Concepts:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Similarity-based Recommendations

# `🗂️TF_IDF_Cosine_Similarity_(CBF) 
This notebook implements a Content-Based Filtering (CBF) approach using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity. The system recommends items based on the similarity of content or attributes between items.

Key Concepts:
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
- Cosine Similarity
- Content-Based Filtering
